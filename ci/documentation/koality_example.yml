--- #Koality: 0.0.1

# All configuration is done in a koality.yml or .koality.yml file placed in the root directory of your repository.
# Yaml is human readable format that represents JSON (dictionaries)
# The following is an example configuration file from one of the repositories for the Koality product itself.

# The first section is the language definition. Define which languages your project uses and what version is needed.
# If a version number is omitted, Koality will revert to sane defaults (latest version)
languages:
  python: 2.7
  ruby: 1.9.3
  nodejs: 0.8.12

# The setup section allows you to define and describe your production environment. We use it to exactly replicate 
# prod so your tests mirror that of production.
setup:
  # The packages section defines dependencies your project needs.
  - packages:
    # Define system packages dependencies here. These packages are installed through apt.
    - system:
      - zlib1g
      - gcc
      - g++
      - curl
      - libssl-dev
      - apache2-utils
      - libevent-dev
      - libpq-dev
      - lessc
    # Here's an example of language specific dependencies. Pip is utilized for python
    # You can define versions of packages or just grab the default pip package.
    # For python, you can also define a requirements.txt file.
    - pip:
      - amqp
      - pika: 0.9.5
      - kombu: 2.5.3
      - pycrypto: 2.6
      - librabbitmq
      - sqlalchemy: 0.7.8
      - pyyaml
      - msgpack-python
      - nose
      - redis
      - eventlet

      - rackspace-novaclient

    # This example is for nodejs. Npm is used to resolve packages.
    - npm:
      # Packages defined directly under npm are install globally
      - iced-coffee-script
      - less
      - testacular
      # If a directory section is defined, "npm install" is run from that directory, installing all dependencies under package.json
      - directory: ci/web/back
  # Defines databases used in a production environment. Databases for tests are local to a particular VM running tests.
  # Currently, only postgres and mysql are supported
  - databases:
    # an example postgres configuration
    - postgres:
      - name: koality
        username: lt3
    # an example mysql configuration
    - mysql:
      - name: koality
        username: lt3
  # Arbitrary scripts can be run at any point in time to do specific configuration and provisioning of the box not handled
  # by our default sections. In this example, a .gitconfig is being created as part of provisioning and rabbitmq is started.
  - scripts:
    # Each of these lines is run as if it was typed into a shell.
    - git config --global user.email "koality@koalitycode.com"
    - git config --global user.name "Koality"
    # When "directory" section is defined, the following command under "script" is run in that directory.
    - directory: ci/scripts
      script: ./rabbitmq_setup.sh

# The following sections are relevant to the building and testing of your code.

# Any script definitions under compile are run pre-testing. These can be used to build your code, create artifacts,
# or run static analysis checks.
compile:
  # Each section under compile can be given an arbitrary name, which will appear in the web ui. We've named the following
  # sections install_platform, compile_webserver, compile_website, but these names can be arbitrary. The script that is run
  # must return an error code. If it returns 0, we assume it ran successfully. Any other code means that this build has failed, and
  # we will prevent the code from merging and notify the committer.
  - build_platform:
      # The path definition defines the directory from which the script will be run.
      path: ci/platform
      # A script which runs to build your code. This should return 0 or 1.
      script: python setup.py install
  - compile_webserver:
      path: ci/web/back
      script: ./compile.sh
  - compile_website:
      path: ci/web/front
      script: ./compile.sh
# The test section defines the running of unit tests to check the correctness of your change. Multiple sections under test allow for
# multiple levels of parallelization. Each section is placed on a different VM and run in parallel. In this example, 
# platform_tests and npm_tests will run in parallel on separate VMs.
test:
  - platform_tests:
      # The path at which the following testing scripts will run
      path: ci/platform
      # The scripts or list of commands we'll be running to test the code. The return value of the list of commands determines
      # whether we consider this run a successful test run or a failure. A returncode of 0 means success, otherwise its failure.
      script:
        - nosetests -sv
      # You can define a timeout in case your tests may hang or run infinitely.
      # The default timeout if one is not defined is 300 seconds.
      timeout: 600
  - npm_tests:
      path: ci/web/back
      script:
        - npm test
